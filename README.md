# Android_Social_Network
Social network app for Android, Tinder style where you can chat, accept/send invitations and view/edit profiles.

Connected to a generic social network server, it allows you to, thought API requests, login and register. 

Once inside the app, you can set-up your profile if it's the first time you are using the app, send/receive invitations to other users and chat with them if there is a match.
The app asks for GPS permission, and later it translates de position to the city where you are, to show the people around you.
